     abstract = "{We identify 66 photometrically classified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
        from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that have occurred within red-
        sequence selected galaxy clusters. We compare light-curve and
        host galaxy properties of the cluster SNe to 1024 DES SNe Ia
        located in field galaxies, the largest comparison of two such
        samples at high redshift (z > 0.1). We find that cluster SN
        light curves decline faster than those in the field (97.7 per
        cent confidence). However, when limiting these samples to host
        galaxies of similar colour and mass, there is no significant
        difference in the SN light-curve properties. Motivated by
        previous detections of a higher-normalized SN Ia delay-time
        distribution in galaxy clusters, we measure the intrinsic rate
        of SNe Ia in cluster and field environments. We find the average
        ratio of the SN Ia rate per galaxy between high-mass ($10\le
        \log \mathrm{(\mathit{ M}_{*}/{\rm \mathit{ M}}_{\odot })} \le
        11.25$) cluster and field galaxies to be 0.594
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.068. This difference is mass-dependent,
        with the ratio declining with increasing mass, which suggests
        that the stellar populations in cluster hosts are older than
        those in field hosts. We show that the mass-normalized rate (or
        SNe per unit mass) in massive-passive galaxies is consistent
        between cluster and field environments. Additionally, both of
        these rates are consistent with rates previously measured in
        clusters at similar redshifts. We conclude that in massive-
        passive galaxies, which are the dominant hosts of cluster SNe,
        the cluster delay-time distribution is comparable to the field.}",

        luminosity of 7 {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a
        total radiated energy of 1.5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{53}$ erg, both
        greater than any known optical transient. The decline is smooth

        secondary mode of emission, while a delayed mid-infrared flare
        points to the presence of dust surrounding the transient. The
        spectra are similar to recently discovered optical flares in
        known active galactic nuclei but lack some characteristic
        features. The lack of emission for the previous 7 yr is
        inconsistent with the short-term, stochastic variability
        observed in quasars, while the extreme luminosity and long time-
        scale of the transient disfavour the disruption of a single
        solar-mass star. The luminosity could be generated by the
        disruption of a much more massive star, but the likelihood of
        such an event occurring is small. A plausible scenario is the
        accretion of a giant molecular cloud by a dormant black hole of

        discovered during an intensive follow-up campaign of S191213g, a
        gravitational wave (GW) event reported by the LIGO-Virgo
        Collaboration as a possible binary neutron star merger in a low
        latency search. This search yielded SN 2019wxt, a young
        transient in a galaxy whose sky position (in the 80\% GW
        contour) and distance ({\ensuremath{\sim}}150 Mpc) were
        plausibly compatible with the localisation uncertainty of the GW
        event. Initially, the transient's tightly constrained age, its
        relatively faint peak magnitude (M$_{i}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        {\ensuremath{-}}16.7 mag), and the r-band decline rate of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 mag per 5 days appeared suggestive of a
        compact binary merger. However, SN 2019wxt spectroscopically
        resembled a type Ib supernova, and analysis of the optical-near-
        infrared evolution rapidly led to the conclusion that while it
        could not be associated with S191213g, it nevertheless
        represented an extreme outcome of stellar evolution. By
        modelling the light curve, we estimated an ejecta mass of only
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.1 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, with
        $^{56}$Ni comprising {\ensuremath{\sim}}20\% of this. We were
        broadly able to reproduce its spectral evolution with a
        composition dominated by helium and oxygen, with trace amounts
        of calcium. We considered various progenitor channels that could
        give rise to the observed properties of SN 2019wxt and concluded
        that an ultra-stripped origin in a binary system is the most
        likely explanation. Disentangling genuine electromagnetic
        counterparts to GW events from transients such as SN 2019wxt
        soon after discovery is challenging: in a bid to characterise
        this level of contamination, we estimated the rate of events
        with a volumetric rate density comparable to that of SN 2019wxt
        and found that around one such event per week can occur within
        the typical GW localisation area of O4 alerts out to a
        luminosity distance of 500 Mpc, beyond which it would become
        fainter than the typical depth of current electromagnetic
        follow-up campaigns.}",

        supernovae (SNe Ia) depend on understanding the effects of
        'contamination' from core-collapse and peculiar SN Ia events. We
        employ a rigorous analysis using the photometric classifier
        SuperNNova on state-of-the-art simulations of SN samples to
        determine cosmological biases due to such 'non-Ia' contamination
        in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-yr SN sample. Depending on the
        non-Ia SN models used in the SuperNNova training and testing
        samples, contamination ranges from 0.8 to 3.5 per cent, with a
        classification efficiency of 97.7-99.5 per cent. Using the
        Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS)
        framework and its extension BBC ('BEAMS with Bias Correction'),
        we produce a redshift-binned Hubble diagram marginalized over
        contamination and corrected for selection effects, and use it to
        constrain the dark energy equation-of-state, w. Assuming a flat
        universe with Gaussian {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{M}$ prior of
        0.311 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.010, we show that biases on w are
        <0.008 when using SuperNNova, with systematic uncertainties
        associated with contamination around 10 per cent of the
        statistical uncertainty on w for the DES-SN sample. An
        alternative approach of discarding contaminants using outlier
        rejection techniques (e.g. Chauvenet's criterion) in place of
        SuperNNova leads to biases on w that are larger but still modest
        (0.015-0.03). Finally, we measure biases due to contamination on
        w$_{0}$ and w$_{a}$ (assuming a flat universe), and find these
        to be <0.009 in w$_{0}$ and <0.108 in w$_{a}$, 5 to 10 times
        smaller than the statistical uncertainties for the DES-SN
        sample.}",

     abstract = "{We present a spectroscopic analysis of the most nearby Type I
        superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), SN 2018bsz. The photometric
        evolution of SN 2018bsz has several surprising features,
        including an unusual pre-peak plateau and evidence for rapid
        formation of dust {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}200 d post-peak. We show
        here that the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of SN
        2018bsz are also unique. While its spectroscopic evolution
        closely resembles SLSNe-I, with early O II absorption and C II P
        Cygni profiles followed by Ca, Mg, Fe, and other O features, a
        multi-component H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} profile appearing at
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}30 d post-maximum is the most atypical. The
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} is at first characterised by two emission
        components, one at {\ensuremath{\sim}}+3000 km
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ and a second at {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        {\ensuremath{-}} 7500 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, with a third,
        near-zero-velocity component appearing after a delay. The blue
        and central components can be described by Gaussian profiles of
        intermediate width (FWHM {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2000-6000 km
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$), but the red component is significantly
        broader (FWHM {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10 000 km
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$) and Lorentzian. The blue
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} component evolves towards a lower-
        velocity offset before abruptly fading at {\ensuremath{\sim}} +
        100 d post-maximum brightness, concurrently with a light curve
        break. Multi-component profiles are observed in other hydrogen
        lines, including Pa{\ensuremath{\beta}}, and in lines of Ca II
        and He I. Spectropolarimetry obtained before (10.2 d) and after
        (38.4 d) the appearance of the H lines shows a large shift on
        the Stokes Q - U plane consistent with SN 2018bsz undergoing
        radical changes in its projected geometry. Assuming the
        supernova is almost unpolarised at 10.2 d, the continuum
        polarisation at 38.4 d reaches P {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1.8\%,
        implying an aspherical configuration. We propose that the
        observed evolution of SN 2018bsz can be explained by highly
        aspherical, possibly disk-like, circumstellar material (CSM)
        with several emitting regions. After the supernova explosion,
        the CSM is quickly overtaken by the ejecta, but as the
        photosphere starts to recede, the different CSM regions re-
        emerge, producing the peculiar line profiles. Based on the first
        appearance of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, we can constrain the
        distance of the CSM to be less than {\ensuremath{\sim}}6.5
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{15}$ cm (430 AU), or even lower
        ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}87 AU) if the pre-peak plateau is
        related to an eruption that created the CSM. The presence of CSM
        has been inferred previously for other SLSNe-I, both directly
        and indirectly. However, it is not clear whether the rare
        properties of SN 2018bsz can be generalised for SLSNe-I, for
        example in the context of pulsational pair instability, or
        whether they are the result of an uncommon evolutionary path,
        possibly involving a binary companion.}",

        measure cosmological distances, but differences remain in their
        corrected luminosities which display a magnitude step as a
        function of host galaxy properties such as stellar mass and
        rest-frame U-R colour. Identifying the cause of these steps is
        key to cosmological analyses and provides insight into SN
        physics. Here we investigate the effects of SN progenitor ages
        on their light-curve properties using a galaxy-based forward
        model that we compare to the Dark Energy Survey 5-yr SN Ia
        sample. We trace SN Ia progenitors through time and draw their
        light-curve width parameters from a bimodal distribution
        according to their age. We find that an intrinsic luminosity
        difference between SNe of different ages cannot explain the
        observed trend between step size and SN colour. The data split
        by stellar mass are better reproduced by following recent work
        implementing a step in total-to-selective dust extinction ratio
        (R$_{V}$) between low- and high-mass hosts, although an
        additional intrinsic luminosity step is still required to
        explain the data split by host galaxy U-R. Modelling the R$_{V}$
        step as a function of galaxy age provides a better match
        overall. Additional age versus luminosity steps marginally
        improve the match to the data, although most of the step is
        absorbed by the width versus luminosity coefficient
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}. Furthermore, we find no evidence that

        first ever identified. An extensive search for an optical
        counterpart of this event, designated GW190814, was undertaken
        using the Dark Energy Camera on the 4 m Victor M. Blanco
        Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Target
        of Opportunity interrupts were issued on eight separate nights
        to observe 11 candidates using the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical
        Research (SOAR) telescope's Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph
        in order to assess whether any of these transients was likely to
        be an optical counterpart of the possible NSBH merger. Here, we
        describe the process of observing with SOAR, the analysis of our
        spectra, our spectroscopic typing methodology, and our resultant
        conclusion that none of the candidates corresponded to the
        gravitational wave merger event but were all instead other
        transients. Finally, we describe the lessons learned from this

        which the 4-m Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) Time
        Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) can classify transients, we
        simulate a magnitude-limited sample reaching r$_{AB}$
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 22.5 mag. We run our simulations with the
        software SNMACHINE, a photometric classification pipeline using
        machine learning. The machine-learning algorithms struggle to
        classify supernovae when the training sample is magnitude
        limited, in contrast to representative training samples.
        Classification performance noticeably improves when we combine
        the magnitude-limited training sample with a simulated realistic
        sample of faint high-redshift supernovae observed from larger
        spectroscopic facilities; the algorithms' range of average area
        under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) scores over
        10 runs increases from 0.547-0.628 to 0.946-0.969 and purity of
        the classified sample reaches 95 per cent in all runs for two of
        the four algorithms. By creating new, artificial light curves
        using the augmentation software AVOCADO, we achieve a purity in
        our classified sample of 95 per cent in all 10 runs performed
        for all machine-learning algorithms considered. We also reach a
        highest average AUC score of 0.986 with the artificial neural
        network algorithm. Having 'true' faint supernovae to complement
        our magnitude-limited sample is a crucial requirement in
        optimization of a 4MOST spectroscopic sample. However, our
        results are a proof of concept that augmentation is also
        necessary to achieve the best classification results.}",

        in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.6. We recover the known

        broad range of scales 8.5 {\ensuremath{\leq}} log

        We find that the SN Ia rate increases with stellar mass as a
        power law with index 0.63 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02, which is
        consistent with the previous work. We use an empirical model of
        stellar mass assembly to estimate the average star formation

        our measurement. Combining the modelled SFHs with the SN Ia
        rates to estimate constraints on the SN Ia delay time

        curves, we find a strong dependence on DTD slope with the SN
        decline rate, with slower-declining SNe exhibiting a steeper DTD

        classification algorithms, and for correcting biases introduced
        by selection effects and contamination arising from core-
        collapse SNe in the photometric SN Ia samples. We use published

        functions, and empirical relationships between SNe and their
        host galaxies to construct a framework for simulating
        photometric SN surveys. We present this framework in the context

        comparing our simulations of DES with the observed DES transient
        populations. We demonstrate excellent agreement in many

     abstract = "{We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of supernova (SN)
        2019cad during the first \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 d
        from explosion. Based on the light-curve morphology, we find
        that SN 2019cad resembles the double-peaked Type Ib/c SN 2005bf
        and the Type Ic PTF11mnb. Unlike those two objects, SN 2019cad
        also shows the initial peak in the redder bands. Inspection of
        the g-band light curve indicates the initial peak is reached in
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde8 d, while the r-band peak
        occurred \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde15 d post-explosion. A
        second and more prominent peak is reached in all bands at
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde45 d past explosion, followed by
        a fast decline from \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde60 d. During
        the first 30 d, the spectra of SN 2019cad show the typical
        features of a Type Ic SN, however, after 40 d, a blue continuum
        with prominent lines of Si II {\ensuremath{\lambda}}6355 and C
        II {\ensuremath{\lambda}}6580 is observed again. Comparing the
        bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN
        2019cad is consistent with a pre-SN mass of 11
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and an explosion energy of 3.5
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg. The light-curve morphology can be
        reproduced either by a double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution with
        an external component of 0.041 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and
        an internal component of 0.3 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ or a
        double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution plus magnetar model (P
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 11 ms and B
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 26 {\texttimes} {}10$^{14}$ G).
        If SN 2019cad were to suffer from significant host reddening
        (which cannot be ruled out), the $^{56}$Ni model would require
        extreme values, while the magnetar model would still be
        feasible.}",

        of 20 cosmologically useful SLSNe I based on light curve and
        spectroscopy quality cuts. We confirm the robustness of the
        peak-decline SLSN I standardization relation with a larger data
        set and improved fitting techniques than previous works. We then
        solve the SLSN model based on the above standardization via
        minimization of the {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ computed from a
        covariance matrix that includes statistical and systematic
        uncertainties. For a spatially flat {\ensuremath{\Lambda}} cold
        dark matter ({\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM) cosmological model, we
        find $\Omega _{\rm M}=0.38^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, with an rms of 0.27
        mag for the residuals of the distance moduli. For a

        a 'baseline' measurement consisting of Planck temperature
        together with Type Ia supernovae, results in a small improvement
        in the constraints of w$_{0}$ and w$_{a}$ of 4 per cent. We
        present simulations of future surveys with 868 and 492 SLSNe I
        (depending on the configuration used) and show that such a
        sample can deliver cosmological constraints in a flat
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model with the same precision
        (considering only statistical uncertainties) as current surveys
        that use Type Ia supernovae, while providing a factor of 2-3
        improvement in the precision of the constraints on the time
        variation of dark energy, w$_{0}$ and w$_{a}$. This paper
        represents the proof of concept for superluminous supernova
        cosmology, and demonstrates they can provide an independent test
        of cosmology in the high-redshift (z > 1) universe.}",

        photometry in a series of 'local' apertures centred on the SN,

        these host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and rest-
        frame U - R colours, and their correlations with SN Ia
        parameters including Hubble residuals. We find all Hubble
        residual steps to be >3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in significance,
        both for splitting at the traditional environmental property
        sample median and for the step of maximum significance. For

        significant than the global stellar mass step (0.057

        samples based on SN Ia light-curve parameters: stretch (x$_{1}$)
        and colour (c), finding that redder objects (c > 0) have larger
        Hubble residual steps, for both stellar mass and U - R, for both
        local and global measurements, of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.14 mag.
        Additionally, the bluer (star-forming) local environments host a
        more homogeneous SN Ia sample, with local U - R rms scatter as

     abstract = "{Rapidly evolving transients (RETs), also termed fast blue optical
        transients, are a recently discovered group of astrophysical
        events that display rapid luminosity evolution. RETs typically
        rise to peak in less than 10 d and fade within 30, a time-scale
        unlikely to be compatible with the decay of Nickel-56 that
        drives conventional supernovae (SNe). Their peak luminosity
        spans a range of -15 < M$_{g}$ < -22.5, with some events
        observed at redshifts greater than 1. Their evolution on fast
        time-scales has hindered high-quality follow-up observations,
        and thus their origin and explosion/emission mechanism remains
        unexplained. In this paper, we present the largest sample of
        RETs to date, comprising 106 objects discovered by the Dark
        Energy Survey, and perform the most comprehensive analysis of
        RET host galaxies. Using deep-stacked photometry and emission
        lines from OzDES spectroscopy, we derive stellar masses and star
        formation rates (SFRs) for 49 host galaxies, and metallicities
        ([O/H]) for 37. We find that RETs explode exclusively in star-
        forming galaxies and are thus likely associated with massive
        stars. Comparing RET hosts to samples of host galaxies of other
        explosive transients as well as field galaxies, we find that
        RETs prefer galaxies with high specific SFRs (⟨log (sSFR)⟩
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -9.6), indicating a link to
        young stellar populations, similar to stripped-envelope SNe. RET
        hosts appear to show a lack of chemical enrichment, their
        metallicities akin to long-duration gamma-ray bursts and
        superluminous SN host galaxies (⟨12 + log (O/H)⟩
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9.4). There are no clear
        relationships between mass or SFR of the host galaxies and the

        (SN II) at redshift 0.0618, detected by the Dark Energy Survey
        (DES). DES16C3cje is a unique SN. The spectra are characterized
        by extremely narrow photospheric lines corresponding to very low
        expansion velocities of {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}1500 km s$^{-1}$,
        and the light curve shows an initial peak that fades after 50 d
        before slowly rebrightening over a further 100 d to reach an
        absolute brightness of M$_{r}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} -15.5 mag.
        The decline rate of the late-time light curve is then slower
        than that expected from the powering by radioactive decay of
        $^{56}$Co, but is comparable to that expected from accretion
        power. Comparing the bolometric light curve with hydrodynamical
        models, we find that DES16C3cje can be explained by either (I) a
        low explosion energy (0.11 foe) and relatively large $^{56}$Ni
        production of 0.075 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ from an
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}15 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ red supergiant
        progenitor typical of other SNe II, or (II) a relatively compact
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}40 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ star, explosion
        energy of 1 foe, and 0.08 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of
        $^{56}$Ni. Both scenarios require additional energy input to
        explain the late-time light curve, which is consistent with
        fallback accretion at a rate of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.5
        {\texttimes} 10$^{-8}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ s$^{-1}$.}",

        We then explore the possibility of performing early-time
        observations for Type IIP and Type Ia SNe in LSST-discovered

        early blue flux in 10 (50) trailing images would rule out more

        host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their
        classification, the study of their formation mechanisms, and the
        cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy
        properties, we create depth-optimized coadds using single-epoch
        DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric
        conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate
        coadd is made from the other four seasons such that each SN has
        a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission.
        The coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}27 in g band, and have a much smaller
        magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates,
        particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting
        multiband photometry of host galaxies for samples of
        spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe Ia), core-collapse

        stellar masses and probabilistically compare stellar-mass
        distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the

        preferentially fewer high-mass hosts at high-redshift compared
        to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are
        consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts are similar to other

        the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and used in
        the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. For the DES-SN sample,
        when considering a 5D (z, x$_{1}$, c, {\ensuremath{\alpha}},
        {\ensuremath{\beta}}) bias correction, we find evidence of a
        Hubble residual 'mass step', where SNe Ia in high-mass galaxies
        (>{}10$^{10}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) are intrinsically more
        luminous (after correction) than their low-mass counterparts by
        $\gamma =0.040\pm 0.019$ mag. This value is larger by 0.031 mag
        than the value found in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis.
        This difference is due to a combination of updated photometric
        measurements and improved star formation histories and is not
        from host-galaxy misidentification. When using a 1D (redshift-
        only) bias correction the inferred mass step is larger, with
        $\gamma =0.066\pm 0.020$ mag. The 1D-5D {\ensuremath{\gamma}}
        difference for DES-SN is $0.026\pm 0.009$ mag. We show that this
        difference is due to a strong correlation between host galaxy
        stellar mass and the x$_{1}$ component of the 5D distance-bias
        correction. Including an intrinsic correlation between the
        observed properties of SNe Ia, stretch and colour, and stellar
        mass in simulated SN Ia samples, we show that a 5D fit recovers
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}} with -9 mmag bias compared to a +2 mmag
        bias for a 1D fit. This difference can explain part of the
        discrepancy seen in the data. Improvements in modelling
        correlations between galaxy properties and SN is necessary to
        ensure unbiased precision estimates of the dark energy equation

        Transient CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at
        t = 69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (L$_{X}$
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and
        radio (L$_{{\ensuremath{\nu}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{29}$
        erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$) emission. The radio emission peaked at
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly
        decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of
        synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave. CSS161010
        launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity
        {\ensuremath{\Gamma}}{\ensuremath{\beta}}c {\ensuremath{\geq}}
        0.55c at {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 days. This is faster than the
        non-relativistic AT 2018cow
        ({\ensuremath{\Gamma}}{\ensuremath{\beta}}c {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        0.1c) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla
        ({\ensuremath{\Gamma}}{\ensuremath{\beta}}c {\ensuremath{\geq}}
        0.3c at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of
        CSS161010 (E$_{k}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{51}$ erg) is
        comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass
        that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is
        significantly larger ( $\sim 0.01\mbox{--}0.1\,{M}_{\odot }$ ).
        This is consistent with the lack of observed
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}}-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by
        a different emission component to the synchrotron radio
        emission. CSS161010 is located at {\ensuremath{\sim}}150 Mpc in
        a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass M$_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        {}10$^{7}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and specific star
        formation rate sSFR {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.3 Gyr$^{-1}$. This
        mass is among the lowest inferred for host galaxies of explosive
        transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are
        consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a
        rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we
        cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally
        located intermediate-mass black hole. Regardless of the physical
        mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of
        rare (rate < 0.4\% of the local core-collapse supernova rate)
        H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.}",

        2019bkc, an extraordinary rapidly evolving transient event

        then display a decline of {\ensuremath{\Delta}}m$_{15}$
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5 mag. With such a pronounced decay, it has
        one of the most rapidly evolving light curves known for a
        stellar explosion. The early spectra show similarities to normal
        and ``ultra-stripped'' type Ic SNe, but the early nebular phase
        spectra, which were reached just over two weeks after explosion,
        display prominent calcium lines, marking SN 2019bkc as a Ca-rich
        transient. The Ca emission lines at this phase show an
        unprecedented and unexplained blueshift of 10 000-12 000 km
        s$^{-1}$. Modelling of the light curve and the early spectra
        suggests that the transient had a low ejecta mass of 0.2-0.4
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and a low kinetic energy of (2-4)
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{50}$ erg, giving a specific kinetic energy

        be unambiguously defined. While the abundance distribution used
        to model the spectra marginally favours a progenitor of white
        dwarf origin through the tentative identification of Ar II, the
        specific kinetic energy, which is defined by the explosion
        mechanism, is found to be more similar to an ultra-stripped
        core-collapse events. SN 2019bkc adds to the diverse range of
        physical properties shown by Ca-rich events.

        our early color measurements, although the exact distance
        depends on the uncertain viewing angle. Additional confirmation

        spacecraft orbital sampling on the inferred distribution of
        magnetic flux ropes, generated through magnetic reconnection in
        the magnetotail current sheet. When generalized, the model
        allows the determination of the number of orbits required to
        constrain the underlying population of structures: It is able to
        quantify this as a function of the physical parameters of the
        structures (e.g., azimuthal extent and probability of
        generation). The model is shown adapted to the Hermean
        magnetotail, where the outputs are compared to the results of a
        recent survey. This comparison suggests that the center of
        Mercury's neutral line is located dawnward of midnight by
        0.37-1.02+1.21 RM and that the flux ropes are most likely to be
        wide azimuthally ({\ensuremath{\sim}}50\% of the width of the
        Hermean tail). The downtail location of the neutral line is not
        self-consistent or in agreement with previous (independent)
        studies unless dissipation terms are included planetward of the
        reconnection site; potential physical explanations are
        discussed. In the future the model could be adapted to other

     abstract = "{The late-time spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powerful probes
        of the underlying physics of their explosions. We investigate
        the late-time optical and near-infrared spectra of seven SNe Ia
        obtained at the VLT with XShooter at >200 d after explosion. At
        these epochs, the inner Fe-rich ejecta can be studied. We use a
        line-fitting analysis to determine the relative line fluxes,
        velocity shifts, and line widths of prominent features
        contributing to the spectra ([Fe II], [Ni II], and [Co III]). By
        focusing on [Fe II] and [Ni II] emission lines in the
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}7000-7500 {\r{A}} region of the spectrum, we
        find that the ratio of stable [Ni II] to mainly radioactively
        produced [Fe II] for most SNe Ia in the sample is consistent
        with Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation explosion models, as
        well as sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions that have metallicity
        values above solar. The mean measured Ni/Fe abundance of our
        sample is consistent with the solar value. The more highly
        ionized [Co III] emission lines are found to be more centrally
        located in the ejecta and have broader lines than the [Fe II]
        and [Ni II] features. Our analysis also strengthens previous
        results that SNe Ia with higher Si II velocities at maximum
        light preferentially display blueshifted [Fe II] 7155 {\r{A}}
        lines at late times. Our combined results lead us to speculate
        that the majority of normal SN Ia explosions produce ejecta
        distributions that deviate significantly from spherical

     abstract = "{Gravitational waves were discovered with the detection of binary black-
        hole mergers and they should also be detectable from lower-mass
        neutron-star mergers. These are predicted to eject material rich
        in heavy radioactive isotopes that can power an electromagnetic
        signal. This signal is luminous at optical and infrared
        wavelengths and is called a kilonova. The gravitational-wave
        source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron-star merger in the
        nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and
        distance estimate. Here we report observations and physical
        modelling of a rapidly fading electromagnetic transient in the
        galaxy NGC 4993, which is spatially coincident with GW170817 and
        with a weak, short {\ensuremath{\gamma}}-ray burst. The
        transient has physical parameters that broadly match the
        theoretical predictions of blue kilonovae from neutron-star
        mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can be explained
        with an ejected mass of 0.04{\,}{\ensuremath{\pm}}{\,}0.01 solar
        masses, with an opacity of less than 0.5 square centimetres per
        gram, at a velocity of 0.2{\,}{\ensuremath{\pm}}{\,}0.1 times
        light speed. The power source is constrained to have a power-law
        slope of -1.2{\,}{\ensuremath{\pm}}{\,}0.3, consistent with
        radioactive powering from r-process nuclides. (The r-process is
        a series of neutron capture reactions that synthesise many of
        the elements heavier than iron.) We identify line features in
        the spectra that are consistent with light r-process elements
        (atomic masses of 90-140). As it fades, the transient rapidly
        becomes red, and a higher-opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta
        component may contribute to the emission. This indicates that
        neutron-star mergers produce gravitational waves and
        radioactively powered kilonovae, and are a nucleosynthetic
        source of the r-process elements.}",

     abstract = "{On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later
        designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed
        through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced
        Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently
        detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1.7 \{\{s\}\} with respect to the merger
        time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was
        initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg$^{2}$ at a
        luminosity distance of \{40\}$_{-8}$$^{+8}$ Mpc and with
        component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component
        masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26
        \{M\}$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}} }$. An extensive observing campaign
        was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the
        discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the
        IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 40 \{\{Mpc\}\}) less than 11 hours after the
        merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1
        m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently
        detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent
        observations targeted the object and its environment. Early
        ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded
        within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a
        redward evolution over {\ensuremath{\sim}}10 days. Following
        early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered
        at the transient's position {\ensuremath{\sim}} 9 and
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 16 days, respectively, after the merger.
        Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical
        process that is distinct from the one that generates the
        UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-
        rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were
        found in follow-up searches. These observations support the
        hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two
        neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst
        (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the
        radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.

        supernova (SN Ia) SN 2015F over -16 d to +80 d relative to
        maximum light, obtained as part of the Public ESO Spectroscopic
        Survey of Transient Objects. SN 2015F is a slightly sub-luminous
        SN Ia with a decline rate of {\ensuremath{\Delta}}m$_{15}$(B) =
        1.35 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 mag, placing it in the region
        between normal and SN 1991bg-like events. Our densely sampled
        photometric data place tight constraints on the epoch of first
        light and form of the early-time light curve. The spectra
        exhibit photospheric C II {\ensuremath{\lambda}}6580 absorption
        until -4 days, and high-velocity Ca II is particularly strong at
        <-10 d at expansion velocities of ≃23 000 km s$^{-1}$. At early
        times, our spectral modelling with SYN++ shows strong evidence
        for iron-peak elements (Fe II, Cr II, Ti II, and V II) expanding
        at velocities >14 000 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting mixing in the
        outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Although unusual in SN Ia
        spectra, including V II in the modelling significantly improves
        the spectral fits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature
        at {\ensuremath{\sim}}6800 {\r{A}} that persists until maximum
        light. Our favoured explanation for this line is photospheric Al
        II, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although
        detached high-velocity C II material could also be responsible.
        In both cases, the absorbing material seems to be confined to a
        relatively narrow region in velocity space. The nucleosynthesis
        of detectable amounts of Al II would argue against a low-
        metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800
        {\r{A}} feature is weakly present in other normal SN Ia events
        and common in the SN 1991bg-like sub-class.}",

        $_{P1}$ filter, starting 11.5 hr after the LIGO information
        release and lasting for an additional 28 days. The first
        observations started 49.5 hr after the time of the GW151226
        detection. We typically reached sensitivity limits of I $_{P1}$
        = 20.3-20.8 and covered 26.5\% of the LIGO probability skymap.
        We supplemented this with ATLAS survey data, reaching 31\% of
        the probability region to shallower depths of m ≃ 19. We found
        49 extragalactic transients (that are not obviously active
        galactic nuclei), including a faint transient in a galaxy at 7
        Mpc (a luminous blue variable outburst) plus a rapidly decaying
        M-dwarf flare. Spectral classification of 20 other transient
        events showed them all to be supernovae. We found an unusual
        transient, PS15dpn, with an explosion date temporally coincident
        with GW151226, that evolved into a type Ibn supernova. The
        redshift of the transient is secure at z = 0.1747
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0001 and we find it unlikely to be linked,
        since the luminosity distance has a negligible probability of
        being consistent with that of GW151226. In the 290 square
        degrees surveyed we therefore do not find a likely counterpart.
        However we show that our survey strategy would be sensitive to
        NS-NS mergers producing kilonovae at D $_{ L }$
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 100 Mpc, which is promising for future
        LIGO/Virgo searches.}",

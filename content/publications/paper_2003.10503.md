description: "We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t = 69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (L_X ensuremathsim 5 texttimes 10^39 erg s^-1) and radio (L_ensuremathnu ensuremathsim 10^29 erg s^-1 Hz^-1) emission. The radio emission peaked at ensuremathsim100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave.

The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 (E_k ensuremathgtrsim 10^51 erg) is comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger ( sim 0.01mbox--0.1,M_odot  ).

CSS161010 is located at ensuremathsim150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass M_* ensuremathsim 10^7 M_ensuremathodot and specific star formation rate sSFR ensuremathsim 0.3 Gyr^-1. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally located intermediate-mass black hole.

We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t = 69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (L_X ensuremathsim 5 texttimes 10^39 erg s^-1) and radio (L_ensuremathnu ensuremathsim 10^29 erg s^-1 Hz^-1) emission. The radio emission peaked at ensuremathsim100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity ensuremathGammaensuremathbetac ensuremathgeq 0.55c at ensuremathsim100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT 2018cow (ensuremathGammaensuremathbetac ensuremathsim 0.1c) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla (ensuremathGammaensuremathbetac ensuremathgeq 0.3c at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 (E_k ensuremathgtrsim 10^51 erg) is comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger ( sim 0.01mbox--0.1,M_odot  ).

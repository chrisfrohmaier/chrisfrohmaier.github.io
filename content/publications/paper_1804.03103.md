description: "We present a measurement of the volumetric rate of textquotedblleftcalcium-richtextquotedblright optical transients in the local universe, using a sample of three events from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). This measurement builds on a detailed study of the PTF transient detection efficiencies and uses a Monte Carlo simulation of the PTF survey. We measure the volumetric rate of calcium-rich transients to be higher than previous estimates: 1.21_-0.39^+1.13 texttimes 10^-5 events yr^-1 Mpc^-3. This is equivalent to 33per cent-94per cent of the local volumetric Type Ia supernova rate. This calcium-rich transient rate is sufficient to reproduce the observed calcium abundances in galaxy clusters, assuming an asymptotic calcium yield per calcium-rich event of ensuremathsim0.05 M_ensuremathodot . We also study the PTF detection efficiency of these transients as a function of position within their candidate host galaxies. We confirm as a real physical effect previous results that suggest that calcium-rich transients prefer large physical offsets from their host galaxies."

     abstract = "{We present measurements of the local core-collapse supernova (CCSN) rate
        using SN discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).
        We use a Monte Carlo simulation of hundreds of millions of SN
        light-curve realizations coupled with the detailed PTF survey
        detection efficiencies to forward model the SN rates in PTF.
        Using a sample of 86 CCSNe, including 26 stripped-envelope SNe
        (SESNe), we show that the overall CCSN volumetric rate is
        $r^\mathrm{CC}_v=9.10_{-1.27}^{+1.56}\times 10^{-5}\, \text{SNe
        yr}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-3}\, h_{70}^{3}$ at <z> = 0.028, and the
        SESN volumetric rate is
        $r^\mathrm{SE}_v=2.41_{-0.64}^{+0.81}\times 10^{-5}\, \text{SNe
        yr}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-3}\, h_{70}^{3}$ . We further measure a
        volumetric rate for hydrogen-free superluminous SNe (SLSNe-I)
        using eight events at z {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.2 of
        $r^\mathrm{SLSN-I}_v=35_{-13}^{+25}\, \text{SNe
        yr}^{-1}\text{Gpc}^{-3}\, h_{70}^{3}$ , which represents the
        most precise SLSN-I rate measurement to date. Using a simple
        cosmic star formation history to adjust these volumetric rate
        measurements to the same redshift, we measure a local ratio of
        SLSN-I to SESN of ${\sim}1/810^{+1500}_{-94}$ , and of SLSN-I to
        all CCSN types of ${\sim}1/3500^{+2800}_{-720}$ . However, using
        host galaxy stellar mass as a proxy for metallicity, we also
        show that this ratio is strongly metallicity dependent: in low-
        mass (logM$_{*}$ < 9.5 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) galaxies,
        which are the only environments that host SLSN-I in our sample,
        we measure an SLSN-I to SESN fraction of $1/300^{+380}_{-170}$
        and $1/1700^{+1800}_{-720}$ for all CCSN. We further investigate
        the SN rates a function of host galaxy stellar mass, and show
        that the specific rates of all CCSNe decrease with increasing
        stellar mass.}",

        discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Using strict

        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.09 in a well-controlled sample over three
        years of operation (2010-2012). We use this to calculate the

        simulations of hundreds of millions of SN Ia light curves
        produced in statistically representative realizations of the PTF
        survey. This quantifies the recovery efficiency of each PTF SN
        Ia event, and thus the relative weighting of each event. From
        this, the volumetric SN Ia rate was found to be r\_

        builds on a detailed study of the PTF transient detection

        transient rate is sufficient to reproduce the observed calcium
        abundances in galaxy clusters, assuming an asymptotic calcium

        8000 square degrees of sky with cadences of between one and five

We show here that the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of SN 2018bsz are also unique.

We present the observed g, r, i, z light curves for these SNe, which we interpolate using Gaussian processes. The resulting light curves are analysed to determine the luminosity function of SLSNe-I, and their evolutionary time-scales. The DES SLSN-I sample significantly broadens the distribution of SLSN-I light- curve properties when combined with existing samples from the literature. We fit a magnetar model to our SLSNe, and find that this model alone is unable to replicate the behaviour of many of the bolometric light curves. We search the DES SLSN-I light curves for the presence of initial peaks prior to the main light-curve peak. Using a shock breakout model, our Monte Carlo search finds that 3 of our 14 events with pre-max data display such initial peaks. However, 10 events show no evidence for such peaks, in some cases down to an absolute magnitude of \u0026lt;-16, suggesting that such features are not ubiquitous to all SLSN-I events.

At these epochs, the inner Fe-rich ejecta can be studied. We use a line-fitting analysis to determine the relative line fluxes, velocity shifts, and line widths of prominent features contributing to the spectra ([Fe II], [Ni II], and [Co III]). By focusing on [Fe II] and [Ni II] emission lines in the ensuremathsim7000-7500 rA region of the spectrum, we find that the ratio of stable [Ni II] to mainly radioactively produced [Fe II] for most SNe Ia in the sample is consistent with Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation explosion models, as well as sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions that have metallicity values above solar. The mean measured Ni/Fe abundance of our sample is consistent with the solar value. The more highly ionized [Co III] emission lines are found to be more centrally located in the ejecta and have broader lines than the [Fe II] and [Ni II] features. Our analysis also strengthens previous results that SNe Ia with higher Si II velocities at maximum light preferentially display blueshifted [Fe II] 7155 rA lines at late times.

The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission.

These are predicted to eject material rich in heavy radioactive isotopes that can power an electromagnetic signal. This signal is luminous at optical and infrared wavelengths and is called a kilonova. The gravitational-wave source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron-star merger in the nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and distance estimate. Here we report observations and physical modelling of a rapidly fading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy NGC 4993, which is spatially coincident with GW170817 and with a weak, short ensuremathgamma-ray burst. The transient has physical parameters that broadly match the theoretical predictions of blue kilonovae from neutron-star mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can be explained with an ejected mass of 0.04,ensuremathpm,0.01 solar masses, with an opacity of less than 0.5 square centimetres per gram, at a velocity of 0.2,ensuremathpm,0.1 times light speed. The power source is constrained to have a power-law slope of -1.2,ensuremathpm,0.3, consistent with radioactive powering from r-process nuclides. (The r-process is a series of neutron capture reactions that synthesise many of the elements heavier than iron.) We identify line features in the spectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (atomic masses of 90-140). As it fades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and a higher-opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta component may contribute to the emission. This indicates that neutron-star mergers produce gravitational waves and radioactively powered kilonovae, and are a nucleosynthetic source of the r-process elements.\n","permalink":"https://chrisfrohmaier.github.io/publications/paper_1710.05841/","tags":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"title":"A kilonova as the electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave source"},{"categories":null,"contents":"On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ensuremathsim 1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg^2 at a luminosity distance of 40_-8^+8 Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M_ensuremathodot .

The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ensuremathsim10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient\u0026rsquo;s position ensuremathsim 9 and ensuremathsim 16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma- rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta. textbackslashtextbackslashAny correspondence should be addressed to .\n","permalink":"https://chrisfrohmaier.github.io/publications/paper_1710.05833/","tags":["gravitational waves","stars: neutron","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"title":"Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We present photometry and time series spectroscopy of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2015F over -16 d to +80 d relative to maximum light, obtained as part of the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects.

At early times, our spectral modelling with SYN++ shows strong evidence for iron-peak elements (Fe II, Cr II, Ti II, and V II) expanding at velocities \u0026gt;14 000 km s^-1, suggesting mixing in the outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Although unusual in SN Ia spectra, including V II in the modelling significantly improves the spectral fits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature at ensuremathsim6800 rA that persists until maximum light. Our favoured explanation for this line is photospheric Al II, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although detached high-velocity C II material could also be responsible. In both cases, the absorbing material seems to be confined to a relatively narrow region in velocity space. The nucleosynthesis of detectable amounts of Al II would argue against a low- metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800 rA feature is weakly present in other normal SN Ia events and common in the SN 1991bg-like sub-class.\n","permalink":"https://chrisfrohmaier.github.io/publications/paper_1609.04465/","tags":["supernovae: general","supernovae: individual: (SN 2015F)","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"title":"Early observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2015F"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This talk looked at Liberty Mutualâ€™s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps.
